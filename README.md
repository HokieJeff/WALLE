Stream Alert Discord Bot

I won't be maintaining this repository, so fork it if you'd like.

Sorry, no in-depth documentation at the moment.  You'll have to figure most of it out yourself.

Quick start (maybe incomplete):
  Update the BotConfig.yml file with your twitch and discord bot credentials.
  Also update the 'streams' section with streams you'd like to announce when they go live.
  Install Python and a bunch of Python libs (discord, json, yml. you figure out the rest)
  Run the program and wait for a stream to go live! YEP
